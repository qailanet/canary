# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors:
    - Ingress in GitHub Codespaces failed to proxy requests (502 or unreachable)
    - Prometheus did not scrape http_requests_total from main/canary due to ingress routing issues
  suggested_improvements:
    - Use NodePort or Istio Gateway for Codespaces environment
    - Adjust Ingress host to match dynamic Codespaces URL to ensure scraping works properly
